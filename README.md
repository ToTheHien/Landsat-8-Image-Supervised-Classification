# Landsat-8-Images-Supervised-Classification
Land cover indicates how much a region is covered by forests, wetlands, agriculture and other land. Otherwise, land use shows how people use the landscape whether for development, conversation, or mixed uses. By detecting land cover in time series, we can detect the change in land use. 

Supervised classification requires classified reference samples in order to train the classifier and subsequently classify unknown data.
